    "AZUMARILL_PA1_TEXT_1": "When this Pokémon hits only a single enemy with an auto attack, a move, or their Unite Move, the hit is always a critical hit. However, when hitting two or more enemies at once with an auto attack, a move, or its Unite Move, the hits are never critical hits. Critical hits deal 150% rather than 200%.",
    "AZUMARILL_BA1_TEXT_1": "Becomes a boosted attack with every third attack, dealing increased damage to enemies within a cone area of effect in front of this Pokémon.",

    "AZUMARILL_MOVE_PLAY_ROUGH_TEXT_1": "Increase movement speed by 35% for 4s and change the next auto attack. When performing the next auto attack, lunge at one enemy in range and deliver repeated blows dealing damage to that target and leave it unable to act for .75s. Using Play Rough will overwrite any active Aqua Tail attack change. Play Rough attacks count as auto attacks for the purpose of items, lifesteal and other benefits.",

When the blast of water hits an enemy, decrease their movement speed for 2s and deal damage to all enemies in an area of effect around the initial target. The blast of water then automatically bounces to another target if one is available. Including the first target, the blast of water can bounce between up to three targets consecutively, and each hit behaves in the same way as the first.

    "AZUMARILL_MOVE_WHIRLPOOL_TEXT_1": "For a short time, four small whirlpools appear that swirl around Azumarill as it moves. If a whirlpool hits an enemy, the whirlpool deals damage to them and restores Azumarill's HP. If a whirlpool hits an enemy player, an increased amount of HP is restored. Note: Moving clockwise against your target will grant more hits against that target, and counter-clockwise will reduce the number of hits.",

    "AZUMARILL_MOVE_AQUA_TAIL_TEXT_1": "Increases the speed and area of effect of the next three auto attacks for 5s.
