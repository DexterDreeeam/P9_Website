    "TYRANITAR_MOVE_DARK_PULSE_TEXT_1": "Exhale a mist of darkness in a horizontal sweeping motion, dealing damage to any enemy hit. If the remaining HP of an enemy hit by this move falls below 50%, they become unable to move for a short time.

While charging power: Tyranitar becomes resistant to hindrances for 4s, movement speed is increased by 20% for 3s (stacking 3 times), and Tyranitar gains a shield (stacking 3 times and lasting up to 5s). If any enemies are hit by the shock wave, Tyranitar is granted piercing strength allowing damage dealt to ignore enemy Defense and shield effects for 8s. If this move hits an enemy, a second shock wave can be released in front of Tyranitar; dealing damage to enemies and decreasing their movement speed by 30% for 2s.
