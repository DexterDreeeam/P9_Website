    "MEW_PA2_TEXT_1": "When Mew reaches level 5, the Move Reset icon can be used to reset Mew's moves and learn new moves. This ability goes on a 20s cooldown after it's used. Each time Mew knocks out or makes an assist on an enemy player, or scores a goal, the Move Reset cooldown is reduced (Knockout: 40%, Assist: 20%, Goal: 5%). Using Move Reset adds 5000 Unite Move energy to Mystical Mirage.",

After 3 counters are stored (they have to be consumed within 8s or they disappear), Mew's next basic attack becomes a boosted attack that consumes all counters and launches a ball of psychic energy at an enemy. During the lock-on animation Mew can use moves. The further the ball travels, the more damage it deals (5% more damage per threshold, stacking additively). This ball pierces through wild Pokémon, but will stop traveling upon contact with the first enemy player.",

Mew gains a shield for 3s and becomes immune to hindrances while using this move. At the end of this move, Mew can jump in a designated direction and becomes immune to hindrances for a short time.

If this move is used again within 4s, the wall is pulled towards Mew and follows them as they move for an additional 4s. While the wall moves with Mew, enemy attacks that pass through it will deal 25% reduced damage but will not prevent enemies from passing and does not shove them anymore.",
